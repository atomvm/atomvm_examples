# `blinky` Application

Welcome to the `blinky` AtomVM application.

The `blinky` AtomVM application will blink an LED attached to pin 2  (`stm32` pin `{b, 0}`) on and off once every second.

> Note.  This example program only runs on the `esp32`, `stm32`, and `pico` platforms.

To run this example, depending on how bright you want your led, connect a 220 ohm to 1k ohm resistor in series with a 3.3v LED between IO pin 2 and GND.

> ESP32 Note.  Many ESP32 development boards already attach pin 2 to an on-board LED.

> STM32 Note. The Nucleo line of boards all have three LEDs on {b, [0, 7, 14]}.

> Pico W Note. To use the onboard LED on a `picow` edit src/blinky.erl and comment out the current `PIN` definition (change to: `% -define(PIN, 2).`), and uncomment the definition for the `picow` onboard LED definition: `-define(PIN, {wl, 0}).`
