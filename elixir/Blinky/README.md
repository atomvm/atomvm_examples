# `Blinky` Application

Welcome to the `Blinky` AtomVM application.

The `Blinky` AtomVM application will blink an LED attached to pin 2 (`stm32` pin `{:b, 0}`) on and off once every second.

> Note.  This example program only runs on the `esp32`,`stm32`, and `pico` platforms.

To run this example, depending on how bright you want your led, connect a 220 ohm to 1k ohm resistor in series with a 3.3v LED between IO pin 2 and GND.

> ESP32 Note.  Many ESP32 development boards already attach pin 2 to an on-board LED.

> STM32 Note. The Nucleo line of boards all have three leds on `{:b, [0, 7, 14]}`.

> Pico-W Note. To use the onboard LED on a `picow` edit lib/Blinky.ex and comment out the current `@pin` definition (change to: `# @pin 2`), and uncomment the definition for the picow onboard LED `@pin` definition: `@pin {:wl, 0}`.
